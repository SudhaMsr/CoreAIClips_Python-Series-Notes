## What This Repository Is ?

This repository is a **structured companion** to the video series.

Each video has:
- Minimal, executable Python code
- Clear written notes explaining the model
- Slides used in the explanation (PDF/PPT)

Everything is organized **by phase and by video number**.

---

## Repository Structure

## Python Core Series – Full Video Roadmap

### 🔹 Phase 1: Python Foundations (Absolute Core)

1. What Python Actually Is (and what it is NOT)  
2. How Python Code Really Runs (Interpreter, Script, REPL)  
3. Variables Explained Like You’re an Engineer  
4. Data Types That Actually Matter (int, float, str, bool)  
5. Why Everything in Python Is an Object  
6. Type Conversion & Common Beginner Traps  
7. Writing Clean Print Statements  
8. Comments, Readability, and Why Bad Code Fails  

📌 Stop after Phase 1. Practice before moving ahead.
